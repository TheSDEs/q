Q was the man or department that supplied James Bond and other
secret agents with cool gadgets:

This repo is a source of cool agent gadgets as well, but they are
for Indy-style [self-sovereign identity agents](

(much cooler than 007 :-).

Q offerss various agents and agent tools that may
be helpful in testing and development, including:

* an agent that talks by email
* an agent that talks through files in a folder (scriptable with simple file I/O)
* a pluggable relay that can translate between different agent transports
